<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We would like to implement a parallel example-based style transfer algorithm.  We are going to do this on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.  We are looking to achieve speedup relative to OpenCV's FLANN (Fast Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search Library).</p>

<h3>
<a name="background" class="anchor" href="#background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Example-based style transfer is the process of transferring the "style" of one image to another. For example, if we have an image of a watercolor painting and an image of a real-world photograph, we'd like to transfer the "style" of the painting to the photograph, while preserving the photographs structure (images below taken from <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/watercolor.html">http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/watercolor.html</a>)</p>

[Filtered Destination Image]</p>

<p>An early pixel-based solution of example-based style transfer is by using "Image Analogies". An image analogy takes an unfiltered image (A), a styled version of the first image (A'), and applies the style to a third image (B), to create the result (B').  In the form of an analogy, this is A : A' :: B : B'.</p>

<p>A simple description of the Image Analogy algorithm is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Compute Gaussian pyramids for A, A', B
for each level l, from coarsest to finest: 
  for each pixel q of B'_l (scan-line order) 
    p = BestMatch(A, A', B, B', l, q) 
    B'_l(q) = A'_l(p)
return B'
</code></pre>

<p>BestMatch tries to find the best pixel p in A, such that the neighborhood around A(p) is similar to B(q). We also want to make sure that pixel p would give a coherent result in the already synthesized neighborhood of B'(q). The initial algorithm uses a serial approximate-nearest-neighborhood search to find the best pixel.</p>

<p>We see two places in this algorithm where parallelism can be used. One thing we could improve is the approximate nearest neighborhood search. For each pixel q in B', we are trying to find the pixel p in A that has the most similar neighborhood to q in B. Calculating the distances from the neighborhood around B(q) to all the neighborhoods in A is independent, so we will definitely try to parallelize this step.</p>

<p>Another way we may be able to speed up this program is by parallelizing across all pixels q in B'. Doing this, however, may lead to very incoherent results (the structure of the original image will get diminished).</p>

<p>There are also patch-based solutions to the image style transfer problem.</p>

<a name="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>

<p>There are two major challenges in this project:</p>

<p>1) We need to improve the speed of the approximate-nearest-neighborhood search.</p>

<p>2) We would like to parallelize across the pixels in the image while maintaining coherence in the result.</p>

<p>If we solve these two problems and have time left, we'd like to use temporal context to make a coherent stylized video.</p>

<a name="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>The basis of our algorithm comes from "Image Analogies" <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-300dpi.pdf">http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-300dpi.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>We have also found a paper detailing a CUDA specific approach to image analogies. <a href="http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/45/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00371-012-0701-4.pdf?auth66=1396815636_90dc75f6739fe23fb6a179e7de74a43e&amp;ext=.pdf">http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/45/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00371-012-0701-4.pdf?auth66=1396815636_90dc75f6739fe23fb6a179e7de74a43e&amp;ext=.pdf</a>.  </p>

<p>Another approach to style transfer is by using stitching patches of the source image to create the destination. Here is a paper describing that approach: <a href="http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/sfchen/Publications/TMM13-style.pdf">http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/sfchen/Publications/TMM13-style.pdf</a></p>

<p>We also found a couple papers on Texture Synthesis on the GPU:</p>
