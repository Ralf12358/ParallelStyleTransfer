{"name":"Parallel Style Transfer","tagline":"Jason Israel and Michael Kamm, Going for Real-Time style transfer","body":"### Summary\r\nWe would like to be able to transfer the style of one image to another.  We are going to do this on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.  Ideally, we would like to achieve real-time analysis.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n### The Challenge\r\nThe most significant part of the challenge comes from achieving a real-time execution.  To help meet our goals, we can reduce the quality of the images, essentially decreasing the size of the problem.  \r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThe base algorithms that we will use come from two papers.  The first describes \"Image Analogies\" http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-300dpi.pdf.  The second describes \"Parallel Texture Synthesis\" http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/paratexsyn.pdf\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nWe would really like to be able to make this happen in real time.  If we achieve this, we can just show a base image applied to a video.  If not, the best we can do is show speedup realtive to a serial solution.\r\n\r\n### Platform Choice\r\nWe are choosing to use the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.  Like the second assignment, this project involves math-intensive image manipulation.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nWeek of April 8 - Serial Implementation\r\nWeek of April 15 - Naive Parallel Implementation\r\nWeek of April 21 - \r\nWeek of April 28 - \r\nWeek of May 5","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
