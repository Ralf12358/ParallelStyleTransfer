{"name":"Parallel Style Transfer","tagline":"Jason Israel and Michael Kamm, Going for Real-Time style transfer","body":"### Summary\r\nWe would like to be able to transfer the style of one image to another.  We are going to do this on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.  Ideally, we would like to achieve real-time analysis.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThe core idea of our project is best described by the term \"Image Analogy\". An image analogy takes an image (a), a styled version of the first image (A'), and applies the style to a third image (B), to create the result (B').  In the form of an analogy, this is A : A' :: B : B'.  Our current starter code executing a similar algorithm currently takes a few seconds on a high definition image.  \r\n\r\nSince we are looking to have this execute in real-time, and specifically for videos, we may spend time looking into caching results for the previous frame.  The logic here is that Since there are many frames per second, there is not a huge change between frames, making it possible to use previous work.  \r\n\r\nThere are also preexisting techniques for parallel texture synthesis.  The current implementation described in our research is real-time as well.  \r\n\r\n### The Challenge\r\nThe most significant part of the challenge comes from achieving a real-time execution.  To help meet our goals, we can reduce the quality of the images, essentially decreasing the size of the problem.  Also, our current starter code is written in MATLAB, so we need to take the time to translate it into C++.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThe base algorithms that we will use come from two papers.  The first describes \"Image Analogies\" http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-300dpi.pdf.  The second describes \"Parallel Texture Synthesis\" http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/apptexsyn.pdf.  We have also found a paper detailing a CUDA specific approach http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/45/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00371-012-0701-4.pdf?auth66=1396815636_90dc75f6739fe23fb6a179e7de74a43e&ext=.pdf.  \r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nWe would really like to be able to make this happen in real time.  If we achieve this, we can just show a base image applied to a video.  If not, the best we can do is show speedup relative to a serial solution.\r\n\r\n### Platform Choice\r\nWe are choosing to use the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.  Like the second assignment, this project involves math-intensive image manipulation.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nWeek of April 8 - \r\nWeek of April 15 - \r\nWeek of April 21 - \r\nWeek of April 28 - \r\nWeek of May 5 - ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
